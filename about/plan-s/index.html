<p>Plan S was a one of the reasons why we launched Episteme Health Inc. - to provide platinum open access publishing options to ensure that both Plan S-funded and non-Plan S scientists can publish on the same platform.</p>

<p>The release of the <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/">Guidance on the Implementation of Plan S</a> [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190616185302/https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/">archived</a>] spells out specific requirements. We detail here how we are (or are planning to) be compliant with each of these requirements.</p>

<h2 id="1-aim-and-scope">1. Aim and Scope</h2>

<p>The aims and scope of Plan S call for us to make our scholarly articles immediately available for free online access and largely unrestricted use and re-use. Plan S also calls for research data to be as &ldquo;open as possible and as closed as necessary&rdquo;. We address all of these aims by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Publishing articles immediately available to anyone with no requirements for access beyond an internet connection. Readers do not need to register or pay.</li>
<li>Giving authors a choice of Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) and Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial licenses. Both CC BY and CC BY-NC licenses meet the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association <a href="https://oaspa.org/membership/membership-criteria/">membership guidelines</a>, although we use CC BY as our default license because it is <a href="https://oaspa.org/information-resources/frequently-asked-questions/#FAQ5">preferable</a> in many circumstances.</li>
<li>Providing detailed guidance in our <a href="/policy/submission-guidelines/">author guidelines</a> on when and how to share data so it is available during peer review and linked to their publication.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-plan-s-compliance">2. Plan S Compliance</h2>

<p>Episteme Health Inc. provides authors with an open access journal that will make their articles immediately available with a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license immediately upon publication. Because we offer authors a choice, it is up to authors to select the CC BY license when they complete a <a href="https://epistemehealth.com/index.php/nab/libraryFiles/downloadPublic/5">License to Publish</a> form.</p>

<p><strong>Rights and licensing</strong>: Authors retain copyright and, as specified in our <a href="https://epistemehealth.com/index.php/nab/libraryFiles/downloadPublic/5">License to Publish</a>, grant Episteme Health Inc. a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to publish their article. Authors retain the right to use, reuse, adapt or republish their article at any time and in any medium.</p>

<p>Authors also retain responsibility for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Handling any permissions requests for uses beyond what is specified by the public license, and</li>
<li>Enforcing the terms of their copyright or public license.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-transformative-agreements">3. Transformative Agreements</h2>

<p>We are an open access publisher that does not charge author fees so we are not subject to a transformative agreement.</p>

<h2 id="4-supporting-quality-open-access-journals-and-platforms">4. Supporting Quality Open Access Journals and Platforms</h2>

<p>If cOAlition S is interested in supporting an open access publication venue that does not charge article processing charges, please <a href="/about/contact">contact us</a>!</p>

<h2 id="5-transparency-of-costs-and-prices">5. Transparency of Costs and Prices</h2>

<p>We do not charge any fees for any of our services, including triaging, peer review, editorial work, copy editing etc. We only ask that authors who receive permissions requests for uses beyond what is specified in their public license share However, this does not mean that publishing is without costs. We have committed to publishing our annual financial statements on our <a href="/about/documents">website</a>.</p>
