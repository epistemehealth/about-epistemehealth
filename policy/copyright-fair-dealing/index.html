<li><p>Articles in Episteme Health journals are typically published with a CC BY 4.0 or CC BY-NC 4.0 license, as nominated by the author. However, for the avoidance of doubt and where the following rights are not already granted by the article&rsquo;s applicable license, authors give additional permission to readers to reproduce and distribute the full work, or to reuse and adapt a &lsquo;reasonable portion&rsquo; of their work for any of the following purposes:</p>

<p>2.1 Medical research,</p>

<p>2.2 Education,</p>

<p>2.3 Scholarship,</p>

<p>2.4 Non-profit or charitable purposes, and</p>

<p>2.5 Any of the fair dealing purposes outlined by the Australian Copyright Act 1968.</p></li>

<li><p>This permission is granted on the condition that the work remains distributed free of charge, at-cost, or at no additional charge when included in a paid product or service. Appropriate attribution must be given to the authors and the journal in which the work is published. Wholesale reproduction and sale is not permitted, except where permitted by the article&rsquo;s Creative Commons license. See below for examples.</p></li>

<li><p>A reasonable portion in this policy is defined as no more than 250 words or 20% of an article&rsquo;s word count, whichever is greater. In addition, licensees may use up to 2 figures or 40% of an article&rsquo;s figures and tables, whichever is greater.</p></li>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>Example 1. A school teacher wants to print copies of an article for their students. But they are worried that the CC BY-NC 4.0 license does not permit the reuse because their school charges student fees and is considered by local law to be &lsquo;commercial&rsquo;. The authors have granted the teacher permission to print the articles in accordance with this policy.</p>

<p>Example 2. A news outlet reports on the article&rsquo;s findings and displays images from the article. They charge subscribers for access to their reporting. In the publisher&rsquo;s opinion, they are covered by fair dealing and, if this is not the case, then they are granted the author&rsquo;s permission in accordance with this policy.</p>

<p>Example 3. A marketing company wants to incorporate images derived from an article in their advertising. If the work is CC BY 4.0-licensed, they may use the work free of charge, provided they acknowledge the source. If the work is CC BY-NC 4.0-licensed, then they should contact the authors for permission.</p>

<p>Example 4. A scientist wants to reuse or adapt a figure from an article for use in a journal published by a for-profit commercial entity. They are unsure if the CC BY-NC 4.0 license gives them permission for such use. In the publisher&rsquo;s opinion, it does, but if that is not the case, then they are granted the author&rsquo;s permission in accordance this policy.</p>

<p>Example 5. A company wants to include an article in a printed anthology that it intends to sell. If the work is CC BY 4.0-licensed, they may use the work free of charge, provided they acknowledge the source. If the work is CC BY-NC 4.0-licensed, then they should contact the publisher for permission.</p>
